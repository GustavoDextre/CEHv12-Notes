# Lab 2: Perform Network Sniffing using Various Sniffing Tools

## Lab Objectives

* Perform password sniffing using Wireshark

## Overview of Network Sniffing Tools

System administrators use automated tools to monitor their networks, but attackers misuse these tools to sniff network data. Network sniffing tools can be used to perform a detailed network analysis. When protecting a network, it is important to have as many details about the packet traffic as possible. By actively scanning the network, a threat hunter can stay vigilant and respond quickly to attacks.
